# Visual Research Management
## Motivation
Research / citation managers like [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) and [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/) are excellent tools for researchers to manage large amounts of related works in their field. However, to form a **mental map** of a particular topic or sub-field, there is only so much a 2-D list view can do.

What if we could **visualize** a **network of research papers** in **three dimensions**?
